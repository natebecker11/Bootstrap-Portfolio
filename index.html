                <p>Hi! My name is Nate Becker. I'm a 34-year-old aspiring web developer currently living in Lakewood, Ohio.
                    My girlfriend Rachel and I moved here in 2016 from Chicago, Illinois. I was born and raised in the suburbs
                    of Chicago, then moved into the city to attend college at the University of Illinois at Chicago. I graduated
                    in 2013 with a BA in Germanic Studies. I spent years managing restaurants before, during, and after college.
                    Currently, I work full time as an Uber driver.</p><p> I moved to the Cleveland area to get away from the hustle
                    and bustle of big-city life. I've really enjoyed living here so far, as there's a nice mix of things
                    to do, from sports to restaurants to culture. All that, without the Chicago traffic!</p><p> In my free time,
                    I love to travel. My most recent adventure was a trip to Scotland last fall. While there, I stayed in
                    Edinburgh and Glasgow, taking in all the historic sights. My favorite part, however, was a long weekend
                    drive up into the Scottish highlands. Truly, some of the most spectacular sights in the world.</p>

                <p>I've been looking forward to this coding bootcamp for a couple months now. I spent quite a bit of time on
                    my own trying to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. While I felt like I made decent progress, I can already
                    tell that this program is going to give me the boost I need. I hope to land a job as a developer once
                    I'm done with the bootcamp.</p>
